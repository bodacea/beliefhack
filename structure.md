# Structure

A 10-session exploration of computational belief methods, exploring:

1. What is belief? What do we hold to be truths, and how do we learn them?
2. Human belief: Psychology of belief. Collapsed and non-collapsed beliefs: what we can learn from Aspergers and other ways to process perceptions.
3. Computational belief: Bayesian and frequentist statistics
4. Practical uses of belief: AB testing and friends
5. Belief given partial information: perception, partial beliefs and multiple-viewpoint theory.
6. Beyond normative beliefs: building systems that don’t just go for the middle.
7. Belief in a complex landscape of ‘truths’ and ‘lies': ACH, Phemes etc.
8. Challenging belief: the interactions between creativity and knowledge \(CK theory etc\), managing rapid belief change \(e.g. scientific revolutions\) and gaming belief changes in populations \(hello, information injection and information incest detection\).
9. Lies, damned lies: how evidence and propaganda interact \(or don’t\), and the influence of desire.
10. Trust but verify. More real-world applications of computational belief; more theories and places to explore.

Intro

* Fake news examples...
* Fake data in the development cycle \(e.g. deliberate wrong answers to surveys, people messing with your baseline etc\)

What is Data science

* the process
* scientific method and hypotheses
* Development applications: HDD, decision support, AB testing

DS and uncertainty

* Belief
* Bayesian probability theory
* law of large numbers
* Sampling and sample sizes: effects on error bars
* Uncertainty in development: why agile cycles help to adjust...

The applied cyncism part of DS

* "art"

Misinformation

* Types of misinformation
* Propaganda
* Fake news mechanisms
* Intelligence and counterintelligence
* Misinformation in development

Misinformation handling mechanisms

* ACH
* crowd verification
* Pre-Bayesian reasoning systems

Conclusions

* Where to go from here
* Thank you

Appendix

* Useful things to read
* Belief in communities
* Belief hacking
* Lessons from robotics
* Belief as a moving thing \(and how to track it\)
