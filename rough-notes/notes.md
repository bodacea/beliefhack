# Rough Notes

We’re in this perfect storm of concepts: data-driven business, profiling, data-driven power exchanges. But don’t think that only one side can do this \(if there are indeed sides; it’s more like there’s population divided by a clever elite atm\).

What is belief? What do we hold to be truths, and how do we learn them?

1. Why do I care about belief?

2. What’s in these sessions?

3. What is belief?

Data science isn't just about the process of moving from questions and data to insights. There's a lot of that, but there's also what I think of as 'applied cynicism': the art of questioning everything in the process, from the biases of people collecting or generating data to the scope and validity of results. Some of this cynicism is built into the process; some of it is those "oh, wait" moments when a result just doesn't ring true. That's useful in an environment whose inputs have the usual errors and uncertainties of anything involving humans; what's becoming more interesting now is how we do data science in an environment with deliberate misinformation and competitive intent. I plan to look at our current data science mechanisms for handling uncertainty/error, at existing mechanisms for misinformation, and pre-big-data reasoning systems to see what we could potentially do.



**Course on belief: 10 sessions. **

1\) What is belief? What do we hold to be truths, and how do we learn them?

2\) Human belief: Psychology of belief. Collapsed and non-collapsed beliefs: what we can learn from Aspergers and other ways to process perceptions.

3\) Computational belief: Bayesian and frequentist statistics

4\) Practical uses of belief: AB testing and friends

5\) Belief given partial information: perception, partial beliefs and multiple-viewpoint theory. 

6\) Beyond normative beliefs: building systems that don’t just go for the middle. 

7\) Belief in a complex landscape of ‘truths’ and ‘lies': ACH, Phemes etc. 

8\) Challenging belief: the interactions between creativity and knowledge \(CK theory etc\), managing rapid belief change \(e.g. scientific revolutions\) and gaming belief changes in populations \(hello, information injection and information incest detection\). 

9\) Lies, damned lies: how evidence and propaganda interact \(or don’t\), and the influence of desire. 

10\) Trust but verify. More real-world applications of computational belief; more theories and places to explore. 



Truth and Data talk

* 30 mins. Use outline above. 
* “What color is this car?” Does it matter? What could help \(what else could I use, e.g. backup systems, confirmation\). 

References: include searching for happiness book \(et that humans adapt\).

Session: feature selection and attention

* [http://machinelearningmastery.com/an-introduction-to-feature-selection/](http://machinelearningmastery.com/an-introduction-to-feature-selection/)
* if you can’t handle everything, what should you ignore? 
* Why do you do feature selection in the first place? 
* How do you compare and use different types of feature?
